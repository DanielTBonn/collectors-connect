# ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR REQS

## Instead of using a CSS library like Bootstrap, consider one of the following suggestions:

<!-- /////////////////  The styling should be decided on as a team but one person who will lead page design should become our expert and teach us/get us started.   ///////////////// -->

Explore the concept of CSS-in-JS, which abstracts CSS to the component level, using JavaScript to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way. Some popular libraries include styled-components(https://styled-components.com/) and Emotion(https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).

Try using a component library, such as Semantic UI(https://semantic-ui.com/), Chakra UI(https://chakra-ui.com/), or Ant Design(https://ant.design/).

Create all the CSS for your application just using CSS.

## Option of adding Stripe for charitable donations/ if we go the ecommerce route.

<!-- ///////////////// Something we'll need to discuss as a team.  /////////////////  -->

Consider integrating the Stripe payment platform. Even if you donâ€™t create an e-commerce application, you could set up your site to accept charitable donations.
(https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/quickstart)

## Bonuses -- Although this is not a requirement for your project, try to also implement functionality to meet the minimum requirements of a PWA:

<!-- /////////////////  Should be easy to make but we'll wait till the very end to do it because Serviceworkers are annoying  ///////////////// -->

Uses a web manifest.

Uses a service worker for offline functionality.

Is installable.


# Our Notes

Let's make a user story asap, it's a struggle coming up with issues in github but I think it would be a good call to take some time to make them as soon as we get started too. Since we already have the shell of the application working we can hit the ground running on creating pages and getting styling to work after we come up with a solid game plan. I think we should divy up tasks where people feel they could make the most impact but since we all need to learn I'm down to pair program or do some type of work swapping. 

First day will be all about figuring out what we're doing and coming up with a good structure for an MVP and maybe extra goals, if possible even do some server side work for our schemas. Second day we can go over ideas for theme and design and start putting it into action.
